# UCBrowser
Two years ago, when i started with software developing, i built a unofficial version of the UC Browser for Windows. Since there is a Android and Windows Phone version, i wanted to cover up Windows. I know that it's relatively basic. I just wanted to share this, as inspiration.

Feel free to use the code. Do what you want with it.
